# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 3 - Day 2

*Prerequisite Knowledge: executing node packages, React with TypeScript, React hooks, HTTP requests*

*Exercise Goals: Gain confidence consuming RESTful APIs using a React with TypeScript application.*

Coding demonstration found at [Medium - Livingstone Asabahebwa - Interacting With RESTful APIs Using TypeScript, React Hooks, and Axios](https://medium.com/swlh/interacting-with-restful-apis-using-typescript-react-hooks-and-axios-part-1-af52920ae3e4)

### MVP

Download, install, and launch the boiler plate found in this repository. Follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/interacting-with-restful-apis-using-typescript-react-hooks-and-axios-part-1-af52920ae3e4) to consume a RESTful API using a React/TypeScript application.

### Stretch Goal
Replace the JSONPlaceHolder API endpoints with [this](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/) very accessible API containing some cool feline facts!

### SUPER Stretch Goal
Find another API to consume or otherwise manipulate! Have some fun and please share your results! We want to see them! =)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
